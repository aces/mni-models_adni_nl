1) MNI ADI non-linear asymmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model

This is a version of the ADNI Average Brain - an average of ???
T1-weighted MRI scans, linearly and non-linearly (?? iterations)
transformed to form an asymmetric model in Talairach space - that 
is specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear Registration 
Package (mni_autoreg).

 Included in this package are the following files:

     mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym.mnc:
	a version of the average MRI that covers the whole brain
        (unlike the original Talairach atlas), sampled with 1mm cubic
        voxels
     mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_mask.mnc, mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_mask.obj:
	a mask of the average brain in mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym.mnc.mnc,
	semi-automatically created by Vladimir Fonov. Note that
	this mask has had holes filled in, so it is a connected volume
	but includes non-brain tissue (eg. the CSF in the ventricles)
     mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_headmask.mnc:
	another mask (full head mask), required for nonlinear mode
     mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_vent.mnc, mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_vent.obj:
        a mask of the ventricles
     mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_ntags_1000_bg.tag:
        tag points for the background for mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym.mnc
     mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_ntags_1000_nobg.tag
        tag points for the CSF, GM, and WM for mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym.mnc
     Cerebellum_Ventricles_SubCortical_Mask-ADNI.mnc:
        a template for the cerebellum, brain-stem, ventricles and sub-cortical
        gray to be used in the CIVET pipeline
     to_icbm152_2009a.xfm, to_icbm152_2009a_grid_0.mnc:
        a non-linear transform to map the ADNI model to the MNI-ICBM152-2009a
        model.

2) MNI ADI non-linear symmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model, hi-resolution

This is a version of the ADNI Average Brain - an average of ???
T1-weighted MRI scans, linearly and non-linearly (?? iterations)
transformed to form an asymmetric model in Talairach space - that 
is specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear Registration 
Package (mni_autoreg). The voxel resolution of this model is 0.5mm 
isotropic.

 Included in this package are the following files:

     mni_adni_hi_t1w_tal_nlin_sym.mnc:
	a version of the average MRI that covers the whole brain
        (unlike the original Talairach atlas), sampled with 1mm cubic
        voxels
     mni_adni_hi_t1w_tal_nlin_sym_mask.mnc, mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym_mask.obj:
	a mask of the average brain in mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym.mnc.mnc,
	semi-automatically created by Vladimir Fonov. Note that
	this mask has had holes filled in, so it is a connected volume
	but includes non-brain tissue (eg. the CSF in the ventricles)
     mni_adni_hi_t1w_tal_nlin_sym_headmask.mnc:
	another mask (full head mask), required for nonlinear mode
     mni_adni_hi_t1w_tal_nlin_sym_vent.mnc, mni_adni_hi_t1w_tal_nlin_sym_vent.obj:
        a mask of the ventricles
     mni_adni_hi_t1w_tal_nlin_sym_ntags_1000_bg.tag:
        tag points for the background for mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym.mnc
     mni_adni_hi_t1w_tal_nlin_sym_ntags_1000_nobg.tag
        tag points for the CSF, GM, and WM for mni_adni_t1w_tal_nlin_asym.mnc
     Cerebellum_Ventricles_SubCortical_Mask-ADNIhi.mnc:
        a template for the cerebellum, brain-stem, ventricles, sub-cortical
        gray, hippocampus, amygdala, to be used in the CIVET pipeline
     hi_to_icbm152_2009b.xfm, hi_to_icbm152_2009b_grid_0.mnc:
        a non-linear transform to map the hi-res ADNI sym model to the MNI-ICBM152-2009b
        model (warning: it's not very accurate).
